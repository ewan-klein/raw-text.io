I have worked for over 30 years in academia on linguistics, natural language processing and text mining. Many of the projects I’ve undertaken during that time have explored ways of applying language technology to concrete problems in a variety of domains.

I was a project leader of the Natural Language Toolkit (http://nltk.org) open source library, and a co-author of [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9780596803346).

Over the last few years, I’ve shifted my area of interests somewhat as as a founder and co-Director of [Edinburgh Living Lab](https://www.edinburghlivinglab.org), which explores the role of data, technology and participatory design methods in meeting the challenges of sustainable future cities.  

I have helped to launch and direct the University of Edinburgh’s [Internet of Things Initiative](http://iot.ed.ac.uk).  I’m currently a Fellow of the [Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) in London. I'm a founder and the chair of Prewired (https://prewired.org), a coding club for under-19s.
