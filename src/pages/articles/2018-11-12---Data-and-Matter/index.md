There is a vast amount of data that is effectively a log of purely digital operation, such as financial transactions. Neverheless, much data has its origin in matter and motion, things and actions. In fact, GIS specialists have claimed that [at least 80% of all datasets contain geographical coordinates](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2549741/it-management/have-you-mapped-your-data-today-.html), and what could be more physical than that? So observing, sensing and measuring things in the world can produce data. Yet most data visualisation these days is trapped behind the screen of a conmputer screen. What about bringing data back to the physical world?
